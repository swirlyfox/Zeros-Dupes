Welcome tourists, to Chew and Swall- I mean the Fox Locomotive Works! Here you will find yourself at least one (1) of my personal projects, most notably my kitbashes (well, thats really the only thing here). Are you interested in a roots blown emd? How about another roots Emd? A third? No? Then what are you doing here ???

In all serious though i set up a donations box for folks that think i deserve money for my work. I do not take commisions though, but i will take suggestions on what to do next!

A: I guess it would depend on what it is? Something major probably no, but something small like an antenna or whatever I feel you could rock yourself. Id rather keep customizations big and broad rather than one single antenna or aircon. Unless you pay the monster tax then i might

Q: Whats the moster tax..?
A: I need caffine to operate so 2 cans of monster is what it will cost ye
